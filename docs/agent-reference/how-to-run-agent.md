## Command Line

```bash
AducIotAgent '<IoT device connection string>' [options...]
```

### Additional Arguments

#### --version

With this option enabled, the reference agent will output the version.

#### --enable-iothub-tracing

With this option enabled, the reference agent will output verbose tracing from
the Azure IoT C SDK. This option is useful for troubleshooting connection

### Simulator Specific Arguments

These arguments are specific to the agent simulator.

#### --simulation_mode=\<mode>

Tells the agent where and if to force a failure. This is useful for evaluating
and testing how Device Update for IoT Hub reports errors.

`mode` can be one of the following options:

* `downloadfailed`
* `installationfailed`
* `applyfailed`
* `allsuccessful`

If no mode is specified, `allsuccessful` is the default.

#### --perform_download

This option will cause the simulator agent to download and verify the hash of
the update.

#### --deviceinfo_manufacturer=\<manufacturer>

This option changes the value of 'manufacturer' that is reported through the
DeviceInformation Digital Twin interface. This value can be used to override the default value of "Contoso".

#### --deviceinfo_model=\<model>

This option changes the value of 'model' that is reported through the
DeviceInformation Digital Twin interface. This value can be used to override the default value of "Virtual Machine".

#### --deviceinfo_swversion=\<version>

This option changes the value of 'swVersion' that is reported through the
DeviceInformation Digital Twin interface.

## Daemon

When the Device Update Agent has been installed as a daemon, it will automatically start
on boot. The Device Update Agent daemon reads the IoT Hub device connection string from a
configuration file. Place your device connection string in /adu/adu-conf.txt.

To manually start the daemon:

```shell
sudo systemctl start adu-agent
```

To manually stop the daemon:

```shell
sudo systemctl stop adu-agent
```
